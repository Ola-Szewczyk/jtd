A technical writer is a professional who creates written content that explains technical concepts, processes, and procedures in a way that is easy to understand for a target audience. Technical writers may work in a variety of industries, including software development, healthcare, engineering, and manufacturing.

The primary goal of a technical writer is to communicate complex information to non-technical audiences in a clear, concise, and accurate manner. They may create a wide range of documents, including user manuals, technical specifications, training materials, online help systems, and other types of instructional content.

To be a successful technical writer, one must have strong writing and communication skills, as well as knowledge of technical concepts and tools. They must be able to research and understand complex technical information and then explain it to others in a way that is both informative and engaging. Technical writers also need to have an eye for detail, as their work often involves editing and proofreading technical documentation.
